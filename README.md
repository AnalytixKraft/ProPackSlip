This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Desktop app (macOS + Windows)

The desktop app bundles the Next.js server and a local SQLite database, so it runs fully offline on a user's machine.

### Run in development

```bash
npm run desktop:dev
```

### Build installers (offline bundle)

```bash
npm run desktop:dist
```

Or build per-platform:

```bash
npm run desktop:mac
npm run desktop:win
```

Windows builds from macOS may require Wine.
Installers are written to `dist/`.
